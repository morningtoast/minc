#MINC - Mini CMS for Custom Applications

2012, Brian Vaughn - @morningtoast

##Story
I needed to manage some content within a custom application I built but
there wasn't any CMS behind it and I only needed to manage
small blocks of content. Rather than try to integrate Wordpress, which
would have been overkill, I created MINC to do what I needed.

##Is this for you?
MINC is intended to be integrated into other applications where a 
full CMS is not needed and the people managing content are somewhat
web savvy. MINC can function as a stand-alone script but should be
customized to fit within your application as well as adding any
necessary security needed.

##Todo
* Documentation
